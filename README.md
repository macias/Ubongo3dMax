## Story

See: https://przypadkopis.wordpress.com/2020/10/18/hacking-ubongo-3d/

## Description

You can find the description of the pieces/blocks codes at above blog post.

Two parameters that control the computing are `PIECES_PER_GAME` (how many the same pieces are allowed in the solution; stock value is 1) and
`BOARD_HEIGHT` (how many layers for the card are used; stock value is 2).

It appears designer of the game cut some solutions so even with the stock setup you will find new ones.
