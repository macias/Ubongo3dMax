## Description

You can find the description of the pieces/blocks codes at above blog post.

Two parameters that control the computing are `PIECES_PER_GAME` (how many the same pieces are allowed in the solution; stock value is 1) and
`BOARD_HEIGHT` (how many layers for the card are used; stock value is 2). With values 2 and 3 for the first card finding all solutions takes
around 50 seconds on my laptop (Intel Core 2 Duo 2.53GHz).

It appears designer of the game cut some solutions so even with the stock setup you will find new ones.
